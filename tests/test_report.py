"""Tests for ``seqforge report`` — the self-contained HTML decision report.

Everything runs offline against a workspace built by the real ``run`` verb on KB-generated bulk reads
(no network, no provider, no onlist). The load-bearing properties: the page is genuinely
self-contained (no external reference can regress in), it stays small, it is byte-deterministic, and
the collector degrades honestly when a piece is missing rather than crashing or inventing a verdict.
