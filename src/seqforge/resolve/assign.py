"""Joint role->file assignment: the injective, cardinality-normalized optimization (§3.3).

An assignment ``A: R_t -> F`` is **injective** (each role a distinct file). ``valid(A)`` selects no
forbidden cell and fills every role. Over valid ``A`` we optimize ``(coverage, Σ(cell + β·prior))``
lexicographically — coverage first (see below), then score. The common single-cell case (``|F| <= 4``)
is solved by brute force over all injective maps; larger ``|F|`` uses an O(n^3) Hungarian on
``-(bonus + cell + β·prior)`` (forbidden as a large finite cost; the coverage bonus is dropped from the
reported score) with a post-check that no selected edge is a forbidden edge (an all-forbidden role =>
unfillable => not a padded win).

**Coverage precedes score.** A file eligible for exactly one role (forbidden for every other) can be
placed nowhere else, so an assignment that leaves it orphaned while a multi-role file takes its role
is coverage-wrong even when it scores higher. We therefore optimize ``(coverage, Σ(cell + β·prior))``
lexicographically: first the count of single-role-eligible files that claim their sole role, then the
score. This is a no-op wherever injectivity already forces the map — the common one-file-per-role case
— and only bites a multi-file-per-role run (many lanes/flowcells under one accession), where a short
barcode read may out-score the real long cDNA read for the cDNA role yet the cDNA-length reads are the
only files that role can take. The coverage term orders the search; it is excluded from the reported
score, which stays the honest ``Σ(cell + β·prior)`` of the chosen map.

The filename prior is a *sub-threshold* nudge (``β << min(weight)``): it can only break an exact
byte-tie, never override a gate or flip validity.
