"""Synthetic FASTQ generation derived PURELY from ``spec.reads`` (R10 round-trip).

The generator never reads ``signature`` or ``backend`` — that is what makes the round-trip
(``spec -> synth -> probe -> recover; assert recovered == declared``) a real test rather than a
tautology. Barcodes with an onlist are drawn from a fixed synthetic cell pool reused across reads so
the recurrence signal (low distinct-ratio) is realistic; UMIs are fresh-random (high distinct-ratio).
